# Modeling of Microbiome Data
In the first chapter (@sec-tidy_intro), the concepts of `tidymodeling` were introduced. In the second chapter (@sec-stat_intro), the statistical concepts that are often used in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics were introduced. The third chapter (@sec-preprocessing) touched upon different preprocessing techniques to apply. This chapter combines the first three chapters to build and evaluate models for a real-world dataset. As mentioned in the preface, the dataset used is 16S rRNA amplicon reads used to investigate the microbiome of MS patients [@Cox2021]. Here, the data is used to predict the disease status an individual given the microbiome.
