# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book introduces the concept of Tidy Modelling through the package `tidymodels`, and is designed to be a practical guide to the tools and techniques that are used in the Tidy Modelling framework. It is aimed at people who are familiar with the basics of R and `tidyverse` and are interested in learning how to use the `tidymodels` package to build and evaluate models. Further, a series of statistical concepts often used in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics are introduced in the context of Tidy Modelling.

To cover all the topics, the book is divided into three main parts. The first part introduces the `tidymodels` package and its core principles such as such as data splitting, pre-processing, model building, and evaluation. The second part introduces some statistical concepts that are often used in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, such as hypothesis testing, linear regression, logistic regression, and diversity measures. The concepts are, where applicable, introduced with a description of the method followed by the math behind it and lastly, visual representation using the `tidymodels` package.

The final part combines the concepts introduced in the first two parts to build and evaluate models for a real-world dataset. A study pertaining to microbiome and disease prediction is used. The raw data are 16S rRNA amplicon reads used to describe multiple sclerosis (MS) [@Cox2021]. The samples were pre-processed using the pipeline described in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WilliamH-R/BioStatistics) from which this book is created. After pre-processing, a count matrix was obtained with 456 samples, and the abundance of 124 genera. For each sample, the sex and age of the person is known among other information. All of these variables are used to build several models trying to predict the disease status of the person.
